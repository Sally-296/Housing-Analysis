# Housing-Analysis
This project was completed as an assignment given to me by Miss Mailiana- cofounder and programs director of 4Tool4 Data Course

 1. Project Overview
 This project focuses on analyzing and predicting housing prices based on various property features,
 including area, number of rooms, available amenities, and furnishing status.
 2. Objectives- To predict house prices based on key property features.- To help buyers and sellers understand pricing patterns according to their preferences.
 3. Methodology- Data Cleaning: Removed null values, corrected data types, and standardized formatting for
 consistency.- Segmentation: Categorized housing prices into High, Medium, and Low ranges using conditional
 logic.- Pivot Tables & Charts: Summarized key metrics across price ranges to identify trends and
 comparisons.- Dashboard Creation: Built an interactive dashboard using slicers and charts for dynamic analysis.- Functions Used: AVERAGE, IF, COUNTIF, PivotTables, slicers, filters, and conditional formatting.
 4. Analysis Summary (Key Insights)- Properties with larger areas and more bedrooms typically have higher prices.- Furnished houses and homes with air conditioning or parking tend to cost more.- Location significantly affects pricing-homes in preferred areas or near main roads are more
expensive.
 5. Conclusion
 Key property features such as size, furnishing status, and location play a significant role in
 determining housing prices.
 6. Recommendations- Invest in Value-Adding Features: Furnishing and air conditioning can significantly boost property
 value.- Use Predictive Models: Apply data-driven strategies to set competitive prices.- Focus on Prime Locations: Target properties in high-demand areas with essential amenities for
 better returns.

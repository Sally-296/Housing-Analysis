# Housing-Analysis
This project was completed as an assignment given to me by Miss Mailiana- cofounder and programs director of 4Tool4 Data Course

# 1. Project Overview
 This project focuses on analyzing and predicting housing prices based on various property features,
 including area, number of rooms, available amenities, and furnishing status.
# 2. Objectives
- To predict house prices based on key property features.
- To help buyers and sellers understand pricing patterns according to their preferences.
# 3. Methodology
- Data Cleaning: Removed null values, corrected data types, and standardized formatting for
 consistency.
- Segmentation: Categorized housing prices into High, Medium, and Low ranges using conditional
 logic.
- Pivot Tables & Charts: Summarized key metrics across price ranges to identify trends and
 comparisons.
- Dashboard Creation: Built an interactive dashboard using slicers and charts for dynamic analysis.
- Functions Used: AVERAGE, IF, COUNTIF, PivotTables, slicers, filters, and conditional formatting.
# 4. Analysis Summary (Key Insights)
- Properties with larger areas and more bedrooms typically have higher prices.
- Furnished houses and homes with air conditioning or parking tend to cost more.
- Location significantly affects pricing-homes in preferred areas or near main roads are more
expensive.
# 5. Conclusion
 Key property features such as size, furnishing status, and location play a significant role in
 determining housing prices.
# 6. Recommendations
- Invest in Value-Adding Features: Furnishing and air conditioning can significantly boost property
 value.
- Use Predictive Models: Apply data-driven strategies to set competitive prices.
- Focus on Prime Locations: Target properties in high-demand areas with essential amenities for
 better returns.
